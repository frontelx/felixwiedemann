## Accessibility

This website contains a basic a11y optimization with semantic HTML areas, headline structure, usage of decorative images and keyboard optimization. It was analyzed for basic a11y errors with [aXe](https://axe-core.org/) and [WAVE](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wave-evaluation-tool/jbbplnpkjmmeebjpijfedlgcdilocofh) browser extensions.

There is no color contrast or screen reader optimization so this website is not fully acecssible based on the WCAG 2.x guidelines so far. 

## Maintenance

The [content directory](https://github.com/agorilla/felixwiedemann/tree/master/content) contains all editable parts of the website.  
This is mainly done with `JSON` and some `HTML` files for more flexible content.

### Documentation
