    <p><br>I like the creative process to be open minded, fearless and honest.
      Each project allows us to explore and reconfigure the elements of visual storytelling,
      finding the artistic approach to express the director’s vision.
      As we come up with ideas and concepts, the story and the characters guide us,
      and we are inspired by the places we see, cultural influences and our personal experiences.</p>

      <p>I look for a visual approach with integrity and substance.
        Whether we mapped it out before,
        or we instinctively capture the moment during the scene, the approach is never arbitrary.
        The camera fuses what we have discovered along the way with the truth of the performances.
        The images will be refracted in the audiences’ minds, taking on new meanings.
        Light, texture, colour, contrast and rhythm - portraiture and atmosphere -
        all carry the potential to resonate and to create an experience of some insight into life.</p>
