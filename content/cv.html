    <p>I see each project as the start of a new journey - to discover the story it tells,
      the people it portrays, the world they inhabit and the human experience it communicates.
      Each project allows us to explore and reconfigure the elements of visual storytelling,
      finding the artistic approach to express the director’s vision.</p>

      <p>The conversations with the director and the creative team are sometimes associative and
        conceptual, other times we forensically examine a detail or moment in the script. In
        these conversations I always like to be open minded, fearless and honest.
        Trusting the story and the characters is fundamental and guides us. Our ideas are infused
        with the places we see, cultural references and our own personal experiences.</p>

      <p>I look for a visual approach with integrity and substance. Whether we have carefully
        mapped it out, or we instinctively capture the moment during the scene,
        the approach is never arbitrary. The camera fuses what we have discovered along
        the way with the truth of the performances in this specific moment in time.
        The images will be refracted in the audiences’ minds, taking on new meanings.
        Light, texture, colour, contrast and rhythm - portraiture and atmosphere - all
        carry the potential to touch us and to elicit an insightful experience of life
        and the world we live in.</p>
