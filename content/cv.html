    </p>

    <p>I see each project as the start of a new journey - to discover the story it tells,
      the people it portrays, the world it depicts and the human experience it communicates.
      Each project allows us to explore and reconfigure the elements of visual storytelling,
      finding the artistic approach to express the director’s vision.</p>

      <p>The conversations with the director and the creative team are sometimes associative and
        conceptual, other times we examine in detail a single moment in the script. In
        these conversations I always like to be open minded, fearless and honest.
        Trusting the story and the characters is fundamental and guides us. Our ideas are informed
        by the places we see, cultural influences and our personal experiences.</p>

      <p>I look for a visual approach with integrity and substance. Whether we have carefully
        mapped it out before, or we instinctively capture the moment during the scene,
        the approach is never arbitrary. The camera fuses what we have discovered along
        the way with the truth of the performances in this specific moment in time.
        The images will be refracted in the audiences’ minds, taking on new meanings.
        Light, texture, colour, contrast and rhythm - portraiture and atmosphere -
        all carry the potential to connect with our inner self,
        to create an experience of some insight into life..</p>
